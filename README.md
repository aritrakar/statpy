A simple package containing some functions for analysing Gaussian and Binomial distributions.
Created for the Udacity AWS MLE Foundations 2021 course.

## Functionality:

1. Mean calculation
2. Standard deviation calculation
3. Bar chart plotting
4. Probability calculation using Probability Distribution Function (PDF)
5. Plotting PDF
6. Adding distrtibutions (note: for Binomial, right now, you can only add them provided their p-values are same)
